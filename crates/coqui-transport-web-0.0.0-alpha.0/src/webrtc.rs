//! One UDP port for WebTransport and WebRTC data channels, and the ladder that climbs a WebSocket channel onto it.
//!
//! A [`Port`] owns a UDP socket and reads the first byte of each packet (RFC 9443): QUIC goes through a loopback relay to an
//! unmodified `wtransport` listener, STUN and DTLS to a data channel. A WebSocket whose ends agreed to climb starts with its datagrams
//! inside the stream, offers a data channel over the channel it already has, and switches when that opens.
//!
//! See [`Datagrams`](crate::Datagrams) for what a caller sees.

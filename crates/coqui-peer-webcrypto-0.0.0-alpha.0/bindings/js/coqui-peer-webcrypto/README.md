# @boriken/coqui-peer-webcrypto

The WebCrypto method of [coqui-peer](https://github.com/Boriken-Dev/coqui-peer), in JavaScript: two peers
prove their P-256 keys to each other and end up with an encrypted session, with no dependency and a
private key that cannot leave WebCrypto. It interoperates with the
[Rust crate](https://github.com/Boriken-Dev/coqui-peer-webcrypto) in both roles, and works behind a
TLS-terminating reverse proxy, because it uses nothing of the connection beneath it.

Not independently reviewed. `AGENTS.md` here is the API, and
[PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/Boriken-Dev/coqui-peer-webcrypto/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md) the wire and what
a relay can and cannot do.

```js
import {createInitiator, loadOrCreateIdentity} from '@boriken/coqui-peer-webcrypto';

const identity = await loadOrCreateIdentity('my.application.peer');
const initiator = await createInitiator(identity, expectedPeerId);
socket.send(initiator.hello());
socket.send(await initiator.answer(await nextMessage()));
const {session} = await initiator.finish(await nextMessage());

socket.send(await session.seal('every later message goes through the session'));
socket.send(await session.close());  // the last record; a stream cut before it is reported
```

`npm test` runs the tests, including the Rust example in both roles and a real browser, which skip with
a message where cargo or a browser is absent.

MPL-2.0.

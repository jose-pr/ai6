## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Renamed: the crate is `coqui-web-channel` (`coqui_web_channel::`) and the Dart package `coqui_web_channel`, at <https://github.com/Boriken-Dev/coqui-web-channel>; modules, types and wire identifiers keep their names.
- A server's WebSocket handshake waits on the socket's readiness rather than in blocking reads, and starts no watchdog thread. Its
  limit still bounds it in total.
- A WebTransport dialer refused by the server, as a listener's admission refuses a source, fails with `Failure::Permission` rather
  than `Failure::PathLost`. `connect` therefore no longer falls back to WebSocket after such a refusal. The refusal is QUIC's
  CONNECTION_REFUSED, which any QUIC server may send and anyone who saw the client's first packet can forge.
- Breaking for a Dart class that implements these: `WebDatagrams.changes` and `DatagramWebChannel.carriedSignals` are new abstract members.
- `Limits::pending` is exact: a driver holds at most that many messages its reader has not taken. A WebSocket held one more, in its
  worker, and WebTransport one more, in its read loop.

### Fixed

- A busy WebSocket on Windows no longer dies with `Failure::PathLost` or loses bytes. A worker polled its socket with a read timeout, which Windows says leaves a connection in an indeterminate state, and a read could fail with OS error 997. It now waits on the socket's readiness, with `mio` under the `websocket` feature: an idle channel takes no CPU and a message no longer waits for a poll to be sent.
- `close` no longer hangs when a channel's failure cannot reach a reader who is behind.
- A WebSocket dialer refuses `ws://` beyond loopback before connecting, so the refusal is always `Failure::Permission` and the server
  sees no connection. It used to connect first, and an unreachable address gave `Failure::Timeout` instead.
- A WebTransport dialer given a host name that resolves to both address families reaches a listener on either. It dialled only the
  first address, so `localhost` resolving to `::1` first timed out against a listener on `127.0.0.1`. It now tries each address, the
  families taking turns, a new attempt every 250 ms beside those still opening, and takes the first to open; a failure that is not
  about the path ends the dial at once.
- A WebSocket `send` after its worker ended answers `Failure::PathLost`. It answered `Failure::NoProgress` when what the worker left
  queued still filled `Limits::queued_bytes`, which read the same as a full queue.
- A WebSocket peer sending a message over the reader's bound no longer kills the worker in a debug build (tungstenite's
  `assertion failed: self.in_buffer.capacity() > len`), and in a release build no longer reads its own full buffer as the peer
  resetting. Either way the socket closed with bytes unread, and the reset made the peer's sends `Failure::PathLost`. The worker
  read through tungstenite again after a read had failed, while closing. It now never does: it closes with code 1009 (1002, 1003
  or 1007 for a broken wire), discards what the peer still sends until the peer closes, and the peer reports `Failure::Protocol`
  to its reader and to its senders.
- A WebSocket whose reader stops for longer than twice `Limits::idle` is no longer taken for gone by either end. The end not
  reading counted the silence it could not hear and ended with `Failure::NoProgress`; it now pings the peer every `idle` instead.
  Its worker sleeps until the reader takes a message rather than waking every 10 ms.
- A busy WebSocket sender reads between every 256 KiB it writes, rather than after as many as 256 queued messages, so a peer's
  close or ping is heard while large messages keep coming.
- A WebTransport client whose certificate the server refuses, or which presented none to a server requiring one, fails with
  `Failure::Certificate` rather than `Failure::PathLost`, so `connect` does not fall back to WebSocket after it. The refusal arrives
  as the server's close of the connection, carrying the TLS alert, which was read only when this side raised it.
- A WebTransport channel whose reader is behind no longer wakes every 5 ms to look for room: its read loop sleeps until the reader
  takes a message.

### Added

- `Channel::set_pending(messages)` changes how far one channel reads ahead of its reader: the driver holds at most `messages` that
  `receive` has not yet returned and reads nothing more from the peer until the reader takes one, so the peer's sends wait. A channel
  starts at its driver's `Limits::pending`, so a listener can start every channel at 1 and a link can raise one once its peer is
  proved, holding a stranger to a single message rather than 64. A new limit governs only reading not yet done: a lower one drops
  nothing, and a higher one lets the driver read on at once. Each message is still judged by the bound for its position, staged or
  not. 0 is 1. The WebSocket and WebTransport drivers return `Ok`; the default changes nothing and returns `Failure::Unsupported`, and
  `Box<dyn Channel>` forwards it.
- `websocket::Dialer::with_local_addr` and `webtransport::Dialer::with_local_addr` bind the dialer's socket to a chosen local
  address before it connects, so a listener's admission sees the connection come from there, as a test of per-source rules from a
  second loopback address needs. Only endpoint addresses of its family are tried. An address this host cannot bind, or an endpoint
  with none of its family, fails the dial with `Failure::Unsupported` (`Failure::Permission` when it is taken or not allowed). The
  `websocket` feature now depends on `socket2`, which `webtransport` already pulled in.
- `Channel::set_max_receive_after(messages, bytes)` stages a change to the read bound by position: the next `messages` that `receive`
  has not yet returned are held to the bound in force, and every one after them to `bytes`. The WebSocket and WebTransport drivers
  judge each message by its position as they read it, so a link can read a peer's proof under the handshake's bound and a large call
  right behind it under the full one, with no race against the driver's read-ahead. A message over its own bound is refused as before.
  The default changes nothing and returns `Failure::Unsupported`, unless `messages` is 0, which is `set_max_receive`; `Box<dyn Channel>`
  forwards it.
- `Channel::peer_certificates`: the DER chain the peer presented and this side's rustls configuration accepted, on a TLS WebSocket and on
  WebTransport, the server's on a client and the client's on a server that asked for one. `None` by default, on a plain WebSocket, and
  when the peer presented none.
- `websocket::Pending::peer_addr` and `webtransport::Pending::peer_addr`: the source address `Listener::next` admitted, which on a
  `webrtc::Port` is the client's rather than its relay's.
- `Channel::set_max_receive` and `Channel::set_max_send` bound what a channel reads and what it sends apart, so a side reading under
  a small limit can still answer up to its peer's. `set_max_message` still sets both. The defaults ignore them, as it does.
- `Channel::send_timeout` waits up to a caller's timeout for room rather than refusing, and answers `Failure::Timeout`, with nothing
  sent and the channel usable, when there was none. On a WebSocket it waits behind `Limits::queued_bytes` with no polling: the worker
  wakes a waiting sender as it takes a message or ends. On WebTransport it replaces `Limits::send` for that call, and a wait that
  ends after part of the message went ends the stream with `Failure::NoProgress`. The default sends at once.
- `Cancel`, from `websocket::Pending::canceller` and `webtransport::Pending::canceller`: abandons a server's handshake from another
  thread, before or while `Pending::handshake` runs, which then returns `Failure::Cancelled` and closes the connection. A cancel after
  the handshake finished does nothing.
- Plain WebSocket beyond loopback by a deliberate choice: `websocket::Listener::bind_plain`, which binds any address with no TLS, and
  `websocket::Dialer::with_plain_beyond_loopback`. Each reports the choice in `plain_beyond_loopback()` and in its `Debug`.
  `Listener::bind` with no TLS, a dialer without the choice and `Endpoints` still refuse it.
- Dart: `StagedChannel.nextSetupBytes` gives a setup message as its bytes, so a peer proof with a binary handshake, such as Noise's, runs on a staged channel. `nextSetupMessage` still decodes text, and the wire is unchanged.
- A ladder of datagrams: WebTransport's own, a WebRTC data channel on the same UDP port, then inside the WebSocket, behind the new `webrtc` feature in Rust and `DataChannelSettings` in Dart, both off by default. `webrtc::Port` shares one UDP port between an unmodified `wtransport` listener and data channels, by the first byte of each packet. A WebSocket with `Dialer::with_webrtc` and `Listener::with_webrtc` starts with its datagrams in the stream, offers over the channel it already has, and switches when the data channel opens. `Datagrams::delivery` and `max_size` follow the path, `path_changes` (Dart: `changes`) reports each switch, one over the limit is refused rather than moved, and if UDP is blocked only the attempt is lost. `Signaling::ByCaller` (Dart: `carriedSignals`) leaves the offer and answer to a caller, to carry inside a proven link, and then nothing tagged inside the WebSocket is taken while the data channel is open. A data channel answers checks only from its WebSocket peer's address and holds to the source its peer nominated; one IP address holds a share of relays and data channels; a relay is kept by a finished WebTransport handshake and ends with its connection.
- Raw datagrams beside a channel's messages: `Channel::datagrams` and `Datagrams` in Rust, `datagramsOf` and `WebDatagrams` in Dart. WebTransport's are the session's own. A WebSocket carries them as tagged binary messages when the client asks with `with_datagrams` and the server agrees, and `delivery` says which a caller has. Nobody is sent a tag they did not ask for.
- `webtransport::Listener::with_tls_per_connection` builds each connection's TLS configuration from the client's source and the
  local address it reached, so a client certificate verifier can judge a client by both. The handshake runs on the listener's own
  threads, where a scope the caller enters around `Pending::handshake` does not reach. `webtransport::Pending::local_addr` gives
  that local address: on a wildcard bind, the one the client sent to.

### Added

- Reliable message channels over WebTransport and WebSocket, in Rust and Dart, with explicit endpoints,
  a fallback policy that never downgrades after a security failure, and shared wire vectors.

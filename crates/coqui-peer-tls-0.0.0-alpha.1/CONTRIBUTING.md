# Contributing to coqui-peer-tls

## Licence

This project is distributed under the **Mozilla Public License 2.0** (`LICENSE`). Its
copyleft is per file:

- **Using coqui-peer-tls imposes nothing on your code.** Depend on the crate and ship a
  closed-source application. The only obligation is that this crate's own source stays
  available to the people you ship it to, which it is, here.
- **Changing this crate's files does carry an obligation.** A modified file must be published
  under the MPL 2.0. Your files beside it are yours, under whatever licence you choose.
- A combined work may be distributed under terms of your choosing (MPL 2.0 section 3.3), and
  MPL 2.0 remains compatible with the GPL.

## Contributor licence agreement

A first pull request needs a one-time signature. The bot will comment with the exact sentence
to reply with; read [`CLA.md`](CLA.md) first. It exists so the project can be relicensed later
without tracking down every past contributor. You keep the copyright in everything you write.

## Before you open a pull request

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --features generate,ca,tokio,pin,serde,acl,platform-roots,fields,aws-lc -- -D warnings
cargo clippy --no-default-features -- -D warnings
cargo clippy --no-default-features --features acl -- -D warnings
cargo test --features generate,ca,tokio,pin,serde,acl,platform-roots,fields,aws-lc
cargo test --no-default-features
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps --features generate,ca,tokio,pin,serde,acl,platform-roots,fields,aws-lc
```

All checks must pass. [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) is the crate's API header and ships in the
package; keep it current with the public API in the same commit. Files are LF, on every
platform. The Rust version is 1.89, checked in CI beside stable, and every Cargo feature is built and tested on its own there.

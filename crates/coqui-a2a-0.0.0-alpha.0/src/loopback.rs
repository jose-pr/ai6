//! A standard A2A endpoint on a loopback address, translating to a link.
//!
//! It speaks the JSON-RPC HTTP binding of A2A 1.0, with Server-Sent Events for streams, so A2A
//! software that knows nothing of links runs on one. Anything that can reach a loopback port can
//! use what the link's peer granted, so the endpoint refuses a non-loopback address, any request
//! with an `Origin` unless it is listed, and any `Host` that is not a loopback name (a page can
//! reach loopback, and DNS rebinding makes it look like another host).
//!
//! The link side is [`Hub::attach`], called with the mux of a proven link; the HTTP side is
//! [`Loopback::start`], which owns a runtime of its own.
//!
//! What a slow client or a hostile agent can hold is bounded: connections by a cap, an unfinished
//! request by a timeout, a client that stopped reading by a stall limit on the socket, and the
//! answers waiting to be written by a budget in bytes, which the agent feels as the stream's window.

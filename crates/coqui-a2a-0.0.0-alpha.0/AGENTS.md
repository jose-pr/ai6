# `coqui-a2a` — API header

Header-file-style reference for the `coqui-a2a` crate: every public item with its signature, contract and gotchas, so the crate can be used without reading its source. It ships inside the package and is self-contained. Development documentation lives with the source at <https://github.com/Boriken-Dev/coqui-a2a>.

| Feature | Adds | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tasks` | module `tasks`: a `TaskStore` for an agent's tasks (std only) | off |
| `loopback` | module `loopback`: an HTTP endpoint on a loopback address (`axum`, `hyper`, `hyper-util`, `tokio`, `futures-util`, `subtle`, `serde_json/raw_value`) | off |
| `cli` | the `coqui-a2a` command (`loopback`, `clap`, `coqui-peer`, `coqui-peer-webcrypto`, `coqui-peer-tls`, `rustls`, `url`, `coqui-transport-web`) | off |

MSRV Rust 1.89. Version `0.0.0-alpha.0`, not published. A default build depends on `coqui-agentic-peer`, `coqui-transport`, `serde`, `serde_json` and `time`. No `unsafe` code. The crate holds the mapping of A2A onto a link and no proof, pairing, sealing or discovery: those are `coqui-agentic-peer`'s. The wire is specified in the binding page (<https://boriken-dev.github.io/coqui-a2a/binding/>).

Imports: the root re-exports `PROTOCOL`, `BINDING`, `A2A_VERSION`, `Agent`, `Caller`, `Events`, `Watch`, `Server`, `ServerLimits`, `Reply`, `Client`, `ClientError`, `ClientTimeouts`, `A2aError`, `ErrorKind`. Public modules: `agent`, `client`, `error`, `model`, `server`, `wire`, and `tasks`, `loopback` (features).

## Constants (`coqui_a2a`)

```rust
pub const PROTOCOL: &str = "a2a/1";      // the link stream token, and the grant a peer needs
pub const BINDING: &str = "https://boriken.dev/a2a/bindings/coqui-agentic-peer/v1";   // an identifier nobody fetches
pub const A2A_VERSION: &str = "1.0";
```

## Server (`coqui_a2a::server`, `coqui_a2a::agent`)

```rust
pub trait Agent: Send + Sync {
    fn agent_card(&self, caller: &Caller<'_>) -> AgentCard;                                                          // required

pub fn Server::with_limits(self, limits: ServerLimits) -> Server

pub fn Server::serving(self, services: Services) -> Services           // adds PROTOCOL

pub enum Reply { Card(AgentCard), Message(SendMessageResponse), Task(Task), Tasks(ListTasksResponse) }          // non_exhaustive, Serialize
pub struct ServerLimits { pub max_request: usize, pub request_timeout: Duration, pub reader_stall: Duration }   // non_exhaustive, Default: 1 MiB, 10 s, 30 s
```

- `call` and `stream` run the checks `serve` runs, in the order it runs them, and answer the error a link would: `VersionNotSupported`, `ExtensionSupportRequired`, `PushNotificationNotSupported`, `UnsupportedOperation` for a streaming or extended-card call the card does not declare, `Internal` for a panic. A streaming method through `call`, or the reverse, is `InvalidRequest` before the agent runs. The card `call` answers has no webhooks and no link interface. `stream`'s iterator ends as a link's stream does (after the item that ends the task, a first message, or an error). The agent is given a `Watch` of the call's own (`caller.watch()` is a child of the caller's): it closes when the caller's watch closes and when the iterator is dropped, so an agent waiting on it is released and the host's watch stays open for its other operations. `call` hands the agent the caller's own watch.
- `Caller::local`'s `peer` is whatever the host says, as true as the host's own code; nothing proves it. The agent authorizes by it as for a proven peer. **Name local peers `local:<name>`**: a proved id is the link crate's `sha256:` form, so no proof produces a `local:` id (a test samples this), and use one local peer per party whose tasks must not reach another's, such as `local:` and the session id of each parent session. `Caller::is_local` tells them apart in an agent.
- Each stream runs on a thread of the link's, one operation per stream. A panic in an agent method is `InternalError` for that operation.
- Before an agent method runs the server checks the method, `a2a-version` (major 1), required extensions, streaming and extended-card capabilities against the card, and refuses any push-notification request. The card the server serves has `capabilities.pushNotifications` false and an interface for this binding first.
- A stream of items ends after the item that puts the task in a terminal state, or after a first item that is a message.
- A send waits for a slow client's credit, up to `reader_stall`. Past that the stream is closed as `broken`. `finish` follows only an answer sent whole.
- An `Events` iterator runs on a thread of its own. A quiet one must return soon after its `Watch` closes, since the operation waits for it.
- `Caller::peer` is the identity: it comes from the link's proof. Authorize per caller; `ListTasks` returns only the caller's tasks.

## Tasks (`coqui_a2a::tasks`, feature `tasks`)

The tasks of an agent in memory, for a host that runs work for callers. No I/O, no thread of its own; std only.

```rust
pub struct TaskStore;                                   // Clone (clones share one store), Debug
pub fn TaskStore::builder() -> TaskStoreBuilder
pub fn TaskStore::limits(&self) -> TaskLimits

// Caller-facing: the owner is `caller.peer`; another caller's task is TaskNotFound; the caller's Watch ends a subscription.
pub fn TaskStore::create(&self, caller: &Caller<'_>, request: &SendMessageRequest) -> Result<Task, A2aError>   // the message names no task; SUBMITTED; history = [message]; request.tenant and metadata kept
pub fn TaskStore::append(&self, caller: &Caller<'_>, request: &SendMessageRequest) -> Result<Task, A2aError>   // the message names the task; changes no state
pub fn TaskStore::get(&self, caller: &Caller<'_>, request: &GetTaskRequest) -> Result<Task, A2aError>          // historyLength: last N, 0 none
pub fn TaskStore::list(&self, caller: &Caller<'_>, request: &ListTasksRequest) -> Result<ListTasksResponse, A2aError>   // newest change first; no artifacts unless includeArtifacts
pub fn TaskStore::cancel(&self, caller: &Caller<'_>, request: &CancelTaskRequest) -> Result<Task, A2aError>    // cancel hook, then CANCELED
pub fn TaskStore::subscribe(&self, caller: &Caller<'_>, request: &SubscribeToTaskRequest) -> Result<Events, A2aError>   // the task as it is, then each update

// For the code that does the work (not a caller; owns nothing):
pub fn TaskStore::update_status(&self, id: &str, state: TaskState, message: Option<Message>) -> Result<Task, A2aError>
pub fn TaskStore::add_artifact(&self, id: &str, artifact: Artifact, append: bool, last_chunk: bool) -> Result<(), A2aError>
pub fn TaskStore::snapshot(&self, id: &str) -> Option<Task>        // whoever owns it: the host's, never a caller's
pub fn TaskStore::inspect(&self, id: &str) -> Option<TaskRecord>   // the same with the owner (a Caller::peer) and tenant, so the host can route
pub struct TaskRecord { pub owner: String, pub tenant: Option<String>, pub task: Task }   // non_exhaustive

pub struct TaskStoreBuilder;                         // #[must_use]; setters named for the setting
pub fn TaskStoreBuilder::limits(self, TaskLimits) / max_tasks / max_tasks_per_owner / max_history / max_history_bytes / max_metadata_bytes / max_artifacts / max_artifact_bytes / max_subscribers / subscriber_queue / default_page_size / max_page_size (self, usize) -> Self
pub fn TaskStoreBuilder::cancel_hook(self, hook: impl Fn(&Task) -> Result<(), A2aError> + Send + Sync + 'static) -> Self
pub fn TaskStoreBuilder::build(self) -> TaskStore
pub struct TaskLimits { pub max_tasks: usize, pub max_tasks_per_owner: usize, pub max_history: usize, pub max_history_bytes: usize, pub max_metadata_bytes: usize, pub max_artifacts: usize, pub max_artifact_bytes: usize, pub max_subscribers: usize, pub subscriber_queue: usize, pub default_page_size: usize, pub max_page_size: usize }   // non_exhaustive, Copy, Default: 1024, 256, 64, 1 MiB, 64 KiB, 16, 1 MiB, 8, 256, 50, 100
```

- **Terminal states.** `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELED` and `REJECTED` are final. After one: `append`, `update_status` and `add_artifact` are `UnsupportedOperation`, `subscribe` is `UnsupportedOperation`, `cancel` is `TaskNotCancelable`, and nothing in the task changes. A task waits (`INPUT_REQUIRED`, `AUTH_REQUIRED`) and works again as often as it needs, never goes back to `SUBMITTED`, and takes no unspecified or unknown state (`InvalidParams`).
- **Subscribers.** The first item is the task as it is, taken under the lock that registers the subscriber, so no update is missed or repeated; then a status update for each `update_status` (its message joins the history) and an artifact update for each `add_artifact`, in the order made. The iterator ends after the update that ends the task, or when the caller's `Watch` closes. An agent that streams a task it has just made subscribes before it starts the work, else a quick task has ended first and the subscription is refused.
- **A slow subscriber never holds up the work.** One whose queue (`subscriber_queue`) is full is cut off; its iterator yields its queued items and then `Err(Internal)`, so a stream is never mistaken for whole. The same error ends a subscription whose store went away before the task ended.
- **Limits are settings, none has a floor.** At `max_tasks` or `max_tasks_per_owner` a new task drops the caller's own ended task that changed longest ago and is `InvalidRequest` when it has none: **another owner's task is never dropped**, so a shared store lets no owner evict or lock out another's tasks except by filling `max_tasks` itself (keep `max_tasks` at least the owners times `max_tasks_per_owner`). Over `max_history` messages or `max_history_bytes` the oldest go; one message past `max_history_bytes` alone, and `metadata` past `max_metadata_bytes`, are `InvalidRequest`. A new artifact past `max_artifacts`, or a change past `max_artifact_bytes` (JSON bytes), is `InvalidAgentResponse` and changes nothing. More than `max_subscribers` live subscribers on a task is `InvalidRequest`; a dropped iterator frees its place. Every limit error carries `ErrorInfo.metadata.limit` naming the setting (`max_tasks`, `max_history_bytes`, ...).
- **Cancel.** The task is marked cancelling under the lock, then the hook runs with no lock held and stops the work. A terminal state the work reports meanwhile (the waiter on a killed child says `FAILED`) lands as `CANCELED`. A second cancel while one is under way answers the task as it is and runs no hook. On `Ok` the store ends the task `CANCELED`; on an error (or a panic, which is `Internal`) that error is the answer, the mark is cleared and the task is as it was.
- **Tenant.** `create` stores `request.tenant`. A request that names a tenant sees only tasks of that tenant (others are `TaskNotFound`, and `ListTasks` filters); one that names none sees all of the caller's tasks. An empty tenant, context id or page token, and a page size of 0, are unset (proto3 JSON); `AgentCard::select_skill` reads `Some("")` as none. The store does not choose the agent: that is the host's, by `AgentCard::select_skill`.
- `list` pages by an opaque token (`p` and hex, bound to this store); a task changed while paging moves to the front. `statusTimestampAfter` is read as an RFC 3339 instant in any offset, else `InvalidParams`. Ids and context ids are `task-` or `context-` and 16 random hex digits; ownership, not secrecy, is what protects a task.

## Client (`coqui_a2a::client`)

```rust
pub struct Client<'m, 'c, C: Channel>;
pub fn Client::new(mux: &'m Mux<'c, C>) -> Client            // sends service parameter a2a-version: 1.0
pub fn Client::with_service_parameter(self, name: &str, value: &str) -> Result<Client, A2aError>   // such as authorization
pub fn Client::with_service_parameters(self, parameters: ServiceParameters) -> Client              // replaces all, a2a-version included
pub fn Client::with_timeouts(self, timeouts: ClientTimeouts) -> Client
pub fn Client::agent_card(&self) -> Result<AgentCard, ClientError>
pub fn Client::send_message(&self, request: &SendMessageRequest) -> Result<SendMessageResponse, ClientError>
pub fn Client::send_streaming_message(&self, request: &SendMessageRequest) -> Result<Events<'c, C>, ClientError>
pub fn Client::get_task(&self, request: &GetTaskRequest) -> Result<Task, ClientError>
pub fn Client::list_tasks(&self, request: &ListTasksRequest) -> Result<ListTasksResponse, ClientError>
pub fn Client::cancel_task(&self, request: &CancelTaskRequest) -> Result<Task, ClientError>
pub fn Client::subscribe_to_task(&self, request: &SubscribeToTaskRequest) -> Result<Events<'c, C>, ClientError>
pub fn Client::get_extended_agent_card(&self) -> Result<AgentCard, ClientError>
pub fn Client::call_raw(&self, method: Method, params: Value) -> Result<Value, ClientError>             // the result member, unread
pub fn Client::stream_raw(&self, method: Method, params: Value) -> Result<RawEvents<'c, C>, ClientError>
impl Iterator for Events<'c, C>     { type Item = Result<StreamResponse, ClientError> }
impl Iterator for RawEvents<'c, C>  { type Item = Result<Value, ClientError> }
pub struct ClientTimeouts { pub answer: Duration, pub item: Option<Duration> }   // non_exhaustive, Default: 300 s, None

pub enum ClientError { Remote(A2aError), NotGranted(String), Revoked(String), Interrupted, Timeout, Malformed(&'static str), Link(Failure), TooLarge }  // non_exhaustive
```

- The client reads the first message of a streaming operation before it returns, so an operation refused up front is an `Err` of the call.
- An iterator ends with `None` only when the peer's `finish` arrived. A stream or link closed in order without one, or anything else that cuts it short, yields `Err(Interrupted)` (or `Revoked`, `Link`) and then ends: it is never mistaken for complete.
- `NotGranted(reason)`: the peer does not serve `a2a/1` to this key (the link refused the open). Check `link::capabilities(mux, wait)?.offers` for `PROTOCOL` first when a clear message matters.
- Nothing is retried. After a lost link, `GetTask` then `SubscribeToTask`; never resend an unacknowledged send.
- The client holds `&Mux`, which blocks a thread: on Tokio, call it from `spawn_blocking`.

## Data model (`coqui_a2a::model`)

serde types for A2A 1.0 in ProtoJSON: camelCase members, enum names such as `TASK_STATE_WORKING`, omitted optionals, timestamps as ISO 8601 text.

```rust
pub struct Task, TaskStatus, Message, Part, Artifact, TaskStatusUpdateEvent, TaskArtifactUpdateEvent,
           SendMessageRequest, SendMessageConfiguration, GetTaskRequest, ListTasksRequest, ListTasksResponse,
           CancelTaskRequest, SubscribeToTaskRequest, GetExtendedAgentCardRequest,
           AgentCard, AgentInterface, AgentCapabilities;   // Default; pub fields; `extra: Object` holds unknown members
pub struct AgentProvider, AgentExtension, AgentSkill;   // Default; pub fields; unknown members are dropped
pub enum TaskState, Role { .., Other(String) }     // unknown names are kept
pub enum StreamResponse { Task, Message, StatusUpdate, ArtifactUpdate }           // one member on the wire; others beside it are dropped
pub enum SendMessageResponse { Task, Message }                                    // likewise
pub type Object = serde_json::Map<String, Value>;
pub fn Part::text(text) -> Part;  pub fn Part::data(value) -> Part
pub fn Message::text(role: Role, message_id, text) -> Message;  pub fn Message::joined_text(&self) -> String
pub fn SendMessageRequest::new(message: Message) -> SendMessageRequest;  pub fn SendMessageRequest::validate(&self) -> Result<(), A2aError>
pub fn TaskState::is_terminal(&self) -> bool;  pub fn TaskState::is_interrupted(&self) -> bool
pub fn StreamResponse::ends_task(&self) -> bool
pub fn AgentCard::link_interface(&self) -> Option<&AgentInterface>
pub fn AgentCard::select_skill(&self, tenant: Option<&str>) -> Result<&AgentSkill, A2aError>   // several agents on one card: the skill whose id is the request's tenant
pub fn TaskStatus::now(state: TaskState) -> TaskStatus
pub fn timestamp_now() -> String                    // 2026-11-02T10:30:00.123Z
pub fn params_as<T: DeserializeOwned>(params: Value) -> Result<T, A2aError>
```

Opaque fields stay `serde_json::Value` or `Object`: `metadata`, `Part::data`, `securitySchemes`, `securityRequirements`, `signatures`, extension `params`, a push-notification configuration. The structs have public fields and are built with `..Default::default()`; a field the schema adds later arrives in `extra` first, where there is one.

## Wire (`coqui_a2a::wire`)

```rust
pub enum Method { SendMessage, SendStreamingMessage, GetTask, ListTasks, CancelTask, SubscribeToTask, CreateTaskPushNotificationConfig, GetTaskPushNotificationConfig, ListTaskPushNotificationConfigs, DeleteTaskPushNotificationConfig, GetExtendedAgentCard, GetAgentCard }  // non_exhaustive
pub const Method::ALL: &[Method];  pub fn Method::name(self) -> &'static str;  pub fn Method::from_name(&str) -> Option<Method>;  pub fn Method::streams(self) -> bool;  pub fn Method::is_push(self) -> bool
pub struct ServiceParameters;      // names lower-cased; Debug shows names only
pub fn ServiceParameters::set(&mut self, name: &str, value: &str) -> Result<(), A2aError>   // 32 entries, name [a-z0-9-_.]{1,64}, value <= 8192 bytes without control characters
pub fn ServiceParameters::get(&self, name: &str) -> Option<&str>;  pub fn ServiceParameters::iter(&self);  pub fn ServiceParameters::is_empty(&self) -> bool
pub struct Request { pub id: Value, pub method: String, pub params: Value, pub service_parameters: ServiceParameters }
pub fn Request::new(id: Value, method: Method, params: Value) -> Request;  pub fn Request::encode(&self) -> Vec<u8>
pub fn Request::decode(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<Request, (Value, A2aError)>      // the id to answer with, and the error; no part of the input
pub struct Response { pub id: Value, pub outcome: Result<Value, A2aError> }
pub fn Response::result(id, result) -> Response;  pub fn Response::error(id, error: A2aError) -> Response;  pub fn Response::encode(&self) -> Vec<u8>;  pub fn Response::decode(bytes: &[u8]) -> Option<Response>
pub const MAX_PARAMETERS: usize = 32;  MAX_PARAMETER_NAME: usize = 64;  MAX_PARAMETER_VALUE: usize = 8192;  PARAMETERS_MEMBER: &str = "a2a-service-parameters"
```

## Errors (`coqui_a2a::error`)

```rust
pub enum ErrorKind { TaskNotFound, TaskNotCancelable, PushNotificationNotSupported, UnsupportedOperation, ContentTypeNotSupported, InvalidAgentResponse, ExtendedAgentCardNotConfigured, ExtensionSupportRequired, VersionNotSupported, Unauthenticated, PermissionDenied, ParseError, InvalidRequest, MethodNotFound, InvalidParams, Internal }  // non_exhaustive, Copy
pub const ErrorKind::ALL: &[ErrorKind];                          // the whole table, in order
pub const fn ErrorKind::{code, reason, message, domain, name, is_a2a}(self)
pub fn ErrorKind::from_code(i64) -> Option<ErrorKind>;  pub fn ErrorKind::from_name(&str) -> Option<ErrorKind>     // name: "TaskNotFoundError"
pub struct A2aError { pub code: i64, pub message: String, pub data: Vec<Value> }     // impl Error; the code of a newer peer is kept
pub fn A2aError::new(kind: ErrorKind, message: impl Into<String>) -> A2aError;  pub fn A2aError::standard(kind) -> A2aError;  pub fn A2aError::task_not_found(id: &str) -> A2aError
pub fn A2aError::with_metadata(self, name: &str, value: &str) -> A2aError;  pub fn A2aError::kind(&self) -> Option<ErrorKind>
pub fn A2aError::to_value(&self) -> Value;  pub fn A2aError::from_value(value: &Value) -> Option<A2aError>
```

Each kind has a JSON-RPC `code`, an `ErrorInfo.reason` and a domain; the table is in the binding page and a test keeps the page and `ErrorKind::ALL` equal.

## Loopback (`coqui_a2a::loopback`, feature `loopback`)

```rust
pub struct Config;                                    // Clone
pub fn Config::new(address: SocketAddr) -> Result<Config, LoopbackError>   // refuses an address that is not loopback
pub fn Config::with_token(self, token: impl Into<String>) -> Config         // Authorization: Bearer on every request, not forwarded
pub fn Config::without_token(self) -> Config                                // every local program can use the link; Authorization goes to the agent. start refuses until one of the two
pub fn Config::allow_origin(self, origin: impl Into<String>) -> Config      // a page of that origin, with CORS answers; by default any Origin is refused
pub fn Config::forward_header(self, name: impl AsRef<str>) -> Config        // passes that header as a service parameter
pub fn Config::with_max_body(self, bytes: usize) -> Config                  // default 1 MiB
pub fn Config::with_max_connections(self, connections: usize) -> Config     // default 64; past it 503. One request per connection
pub fn Config::with_request_timeout(self, limit: Duration) -> Config        // default 10 s, head and body each
pub fn Config::with_write_stall(self, limit: Duration) -> Config            // default 30 s; the socket taking nothing while an answer waits closes the connection
pub fn Config::with_answer_timeout(self, limit: Duration) -> Config         // default 300 s; for the agent to say anything to an operation
pub fn Config::with_max_buffered(self, bytes: usize) -> Config              // default 64 MiB; of answers waiting, across connections
pub fn Config::with_card_cache(self, limit: Duration) -> Config             // default 60 s; zero asks every time
pub struct Hub;                                       // Default
pub fn Hub::new() -> Arc<Hub>;  pub fn Hub::is_up(&self) -> bool
pub fn Hub::attach<C: Channel>(&self, mux: &Mux<'_, C>)      // blocks inside Mux::run's body, until the link ends or close(); refuses streams the peer opens; a client that stopped reading does not hold it up
pub fn Hub::close(&self)
pub struct Loopback;                                  // a running endpoint; Drop stops it
pub fn Loopback::start(config: Config, hub: Arc<Hub>) -> Result<Loopback, LoopbackError>   // owns a runtime on a thread of its own
pub fn Loopback::local_addr(&self) -> SocketAddr
pub enum LoopbackError { NotLoopback, TokenUndecided, BadToken, BadOrigin(String), Io(io::Error) }   // non_exhaustive
```

`POST /` takes one JSON-RPC 2.0 request (`application/json`, at most the body limit) and answers JSON, or Server-Sent Events for `SendStreamingMessage` and `SubscribeToTask`. `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json` answers the link's card, kept for a while unless a header it was asked with could be a credential, with `supportedInterfaces` naming this endpoint, `capabilities.pushNotifications` false, no member A2A 1.0 does not define, no `signatures`, and no OAuth or OpenID Connect scheme or a requirement naming one. Anything else is 404 or 405. `Host` has to be `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]` or `localhost` with the bound port; any `Origin` not listed is 403, and so is what a browser marks as coming from a page: `Sec-Fetch-Site`, `-Dest`, `-User`, or a `Sec-Fetch-Mode` other than `cors`, unless a listed `Origin` came with it. Headers `a2a-*`, those named by `forward_header`, and `authorization` when there is no token become service parameters, several of one name joined with `, `. With no link attached an operation answers 503. A stream ended by the agent with no `finish` reaches the client as a last JSON-RPC error; one given up on closes the connection with no last chunk.

[--token-file <file> | --no-token] [--answer-timeout <seconds>] [--ca-file <pem>]`. Prints `http://<addr>/` on standard output and, unless `--no-token`, the token file's path on the next line, then redials with backoff when the link ends. It proves by the identity's method, Noise or WebCrypto; a new identity is Noise's. The token file defaults to `a2a-loopback.token` in this user's directory, made the first time. A token file that is empty, past 4 KiB, not a file, holds more than visible ASCII, or on Unix can be reached by group or others stops the command. Exit 0 stopped, 1 failed, 2 usage.

## Environment variables

`COQUI_A2A_URL`, `COQUI_A2A_LISTEN`, `COQUI_A2A_TOKEN_FILE` (flags of `loopback`); `COQUI_AGENTIC_PEER_HOME` (the link crate's identity and trust store directory).

## Gotchas

- A peer must be **granted** `a2a/1` in the link's peer store; being paired for another protocol does not give it. A grant added or removed counts on a running link within its recheck, and a running stream of a removed grant ends as `Revoked`.
- The link replays nothing: a stream cut short is incomplete. Reopen with `GetTask` and `SubscribeToTask`.
- The token is what keeps other programs and users of the machine off the link. On Windows nothing checks the token file's access list: it is private because `%LOCALAPPDATA%` is.
- The endpoint's streaming responses end when the link's stream ends; an HTTP client that leaves closes the link stream, which does not cancel the task.
- Anything that can connect can hold a connection for the request timeout before any token is asked for. A client with the token can hold the link's 16 streams with quiet subscriptions for as long as it stays connected.
- A credential the agent's card names reaches it only as a service parameter: `Authorization` needs `--no-token`, another header needs `--forward-header`.
- `wss://` links: without `--ca-file` the certificate is not checked and the in-band proof alone names the peer.
